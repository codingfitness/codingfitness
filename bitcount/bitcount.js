// Write a function that takes an (unsigned) integer as input,
// and returns the number of bits that are equal to one 
// in the binary representation of that number.

// Example:
// The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010,
// so the function should return 5 in this case.

// This article might be useful to understand the context of the problem:
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight ,
// but it is not at all needed to solve the toy problem.


var bitcount = function (n) {
  // Your code here
