// This problem becomes interesting when you add the time constraint:
// the time complexity should be better than linear.

// You are given an array of unique integers. The array is sorted in increasing order.
// The function indexIdentity should find an integer from the array
// that is equal to its index.

// Example
// In the array [-3, -1, 1, 3, 5], the number 3 equals its index 3.

// If there are no integers like this in the array, return the string "no".
// If there are several integers that satisfy this condition, return any of them.

// Reminder: the time complexity should be better than linear.

var indexIdentity = function(arr) {
  // Your code here
