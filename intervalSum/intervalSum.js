/*Write a function called intervalSum that accepts an array of intervals,
and returns the sum of all the interval lengths.
Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.

Intervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array.
The first value of the interval will always be less than the second value.
Interval example: [2, 8] is an interval from 2 to 8. The length of this interval is 6.

Examples

1) If intervals do not overlap:

intervalSum([[2, 6], [8, 10], [21, 25]]); // returns 10;

2) If intervals overlap:

intervalSum([[1, 3], [2, 6], [10, 12], [1, 3]]); // returns 7;

Intervals [1, 3], [2, 6] and the second [1, 3] overlap
and should be treated as a single interval [1, 6].
The length of this interval is 5. The length of [10, 12] is 2.
