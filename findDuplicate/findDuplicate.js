// This problem is all about constraints.

// You are given an unsorted list of N+1 integers between 1 and N.
// You know there's at least one duplicate, but there might be more.
// For example, if N=3, the list might be 3, 1, 1, 3 or it might be 1, 3, 2, 2.

// Given the list (an array), return a number that appears in the list
// more than once.
// (In the first example, you can return '1' or '3' - not both.)

// Constraints:
// The time complexity should be better than O(n^2).
// The space complexity should be O(1).
// You cannot manipulate the original list (e.g. sort it).


var findDuplicate = function (list) {
  // Your code here
